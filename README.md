# Movie-Locations-Map
A map of TV & Film locations using Google Maps, Node &amp; MongoDB

I wanted to create a google maps site that would record the coordinates from a form field, add them to a database and then take the data from the database and add map markers to the map.

On the advice of @HurrieCrane I used Node JS, Express and MongoDB

I also used the google maps javascript api.

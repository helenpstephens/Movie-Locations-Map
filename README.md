# Movie-Locations-Map
A map of TV & Film locations using Google Maps, Node &amp; MongoDB

I wanted to create a google maps site that would record the coordinates from a form field, add them to a database and then take the data from the database and add map markers to the map.

I used Node JS, Express and MongoDB. 
I also used the google maps javascript api.

Initially I'd also used Pug and while the form worked fine and wrote to the database but I was struggling to get the map to talk to the database to retrieve the markers. 

I recreated the whole thing based on a working example of the map markers that @HurrieCrane shared with me and then I recreated the form in HTML and added in a Mongoose Schema.
